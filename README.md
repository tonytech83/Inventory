# IT Inventory
IT Inventory is a CMDB application inspired by the need to replace an Excel file as a tool.


After launching the application, the first registered user becomes a superuser and creates one time an organization to which all created businesses are connected. All other newly registered users have staff status, and they can only manage the businesses they have created.
